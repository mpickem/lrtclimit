These are the four Mathematica notebooks showing the analytic connection between the
inter-band and intra-band kernels for both the Kubo and the Boltzmann expressions in my thesis.

To this end, one constructs a vectorial difference of the two relevant poles in the complex (half) plane,
and takes the (angle-resolved) limit.

The inter-band Kubo equations collapse neatly onto the intra-band equations (see Kubo notebooks).
The inter-band Boltzmann equations need additional (non Gamma leading) terms for the intra-band equations to emerge.
Further, here the intra-band heat-heat kernels require additional terms.
